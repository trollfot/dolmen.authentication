Changes
=======

2.0a1 (unreleased)
------------------

- Removed the ILocation adapter for IPrincipalInfo as we no longer rely on
  ``zope.authentication``.

- Using now the Cromlech stack.

- Cleaned up the use of ``zope.container``.

- Added the `IChangePassword` interface.

- Added French translation.

- IPasswordProtected change. Password can be a plain str or a unicode
  value now.


0.2 (2010-05-29)
----------------

- the LocatablePrincipalInfo adapter now implements _and_ provides
  the IPrincipalInfo interface. This allows the adapter to be used in
  the AuthenticatedPrincipalFactory adaptation.

----------------

- Initial release.
